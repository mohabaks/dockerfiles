## About

This repository contains Dockerfiles for various tools I use for CTFs/BugBounty. Using
containers provides me with the flexibility and convenience of running these tools
without the need for dedicated virtual machines, making it ideal for my low-power
laptops and reducing the hassle of managing different environments.

> Some of the Dockerfiles included in this repository are collected from other projects and have been slightly modified. All credit and thanks for those Dockerfiles belong to their original authors and contributors.

## Installation

Make sure you have either Docker or Podman installed on your system:
- Docker Installation: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Podman Installation: [Install Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)

1. To quickly build the Docker images, use the provided build script:
  
   ```sh
   $ # Clone the repo
   $ git clone https://github.com/mohabaks/dockerfiles.git
   $ cd dockerfile
   $ # Build all Dockerfiles:
   $ ./build.sh -a
   $ # Build a specific image, such as nmap
   $ ./build.sh -n nmap -t nmap:latest
   $ # For more options, refer to the help menu:
   $ ./build.sh -h
   ```
2. Source the provided sample [.podmanfunc](https://github.com/mohabaks/dockerfiles/blob/main/.podmanfunc).The script define the podman commands used to run the containers. Feel free to adjust the container settings, volumes, or other parameters according to your needs:

    ```sh
    $ source .podmanfunc
    $ # e.g run nmap from previous build image
    $ nmap -h
    ```
